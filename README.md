# satisfactory-blueprints

A collection of my in-game blueprint designs for Satisfactory.

# How to Use

On Windows, blueprint files can be found in "%LocalAppData%\\FactoryGame\\Saved\\SaveGames\\blueprints\\".

Copy the .sbp files you want from here into your save game's folder in that blueprints directory, and you'll be able to use the blueprints in-game.

# Blueprint List/Notes

## 4x4 - Smart Plating v0.2.sbp
- Consumes 93/min Iron Ore (232.5 overclocked)
- Produces 4/min Smart Plating (10/min overclocked)
- Does not use any alternative recipes

## 5x5 - Crystal Oscillator v0.2.sbp
- Consumes:
    - 4.975/min Copper Ore (*)
    - 19.901/min Iron Ore
    - 30/min Raw Quartz
- Produces 1/min Crystal Oscillator
- Uses the following alternate recipes:
    - Iron Alloy Ingot
    - Iron Wire
    - Stitched Iron Plate
- (*) Copper Ore was used because I was optimizing/using all recipes in the Satisfactory Tools production calculator.  You can easily remove this requirement by replacing the foundry with a pair of Smelters producing Iron Ingots.
